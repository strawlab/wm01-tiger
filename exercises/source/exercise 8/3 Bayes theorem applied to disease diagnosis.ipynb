    " ## Disease diagnosis with Bayes' theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that you know the prevalence of a disease (it could be a viral infection with SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) is 1% in a population of people. We have a test for the virus, which, given a person has the disease, will have a positive result 90% of the time. This is called the *true positive rate* (*TPR*), or *sensitivity*, of a test (and also called *recall* and *hit rate* in machine learning contexts). Unfortunately the test also gives a false positive (a positive result with no disease) 5% of the time. This is called the *false positive rate* (*FPR*). (The *specificity* of a test is `1-FPR`, so this test would have a 95% specificity.)\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [Wikipedia page on Sensitivity and specificity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity) for more details about the definitions of these names and the relations between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is standard practice to report sensitivity and specificity when characterizing a test. For example, the European Commission previously published [this list of SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid tests (PDF)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220122135627if_/https://ec.europa.eu/health/system/files/2022-01/covid-19_rat_common-list_en.pdf). (This list is now [offline](https://ec.europa.eu/health/system/files/2022-01/covid-19_rat_common-list_en.pdf).) The Paul Ehrlich Institute publishes independent laboratory results of the [sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests](https://www.pei.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/newsroom/dossiers/evaluierung-sensitivitaet-sars-cov-2-antigentests.html) but does not include specificity data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to work through the probability that a person in this population has the disease given a positive test result. We will write a positive test result as $\\rm{T}$. So, mathematically, we want to solve for $P(\\rm{disease}|\\rm{T})$ - the probability of having the disease given a positive test result. We will use Bayes' theorem to calculate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that Bayes' theorem is\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A|B)=\\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use variable names suited for our problem here. `A` will be `disease`, `B` will be `T` which means positive test result. So, rewriting Bayes' theorem with these new names, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(\\rm{disease}|\\rm{T})=\\frac{P(\\rm{T}|\\rm{disease})P(\\rm{disease})}{P(\\rm{T})}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bayesian terms, we can understand this as follows. Our *prior* belief is $P(\\rm{disease})$. This is our belief about the chances of having the disease prior to knowing the test results, and we take the population prevalence as our prior for this individual. We want to update our beliefs to compute our *posterior* belief $P(\\rm{disease}|\\rm{T})$. In other words, we want to update our belief of disease probability state given a positive test result. In Bayesian terms, our *likelhood function* is $P(\\rm{T}|\\rm{disease})$, the probability of a positive test result given the presence of the disease. As discussed above, this is the test sensitivity, or true positive rate (TPR).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you will need to make use of the fact that the probability of a positive result is the sum of the true and false positive probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
